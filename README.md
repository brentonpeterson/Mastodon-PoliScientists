# Mastodon Political Scientists

This repository provides a simple web app that allows one to bulk-follow political scientists on the FOSS microblogging service Mastodon. In it you can create a csv-file that can be uploaded in any account's mastodon settings, in order to follow a list of many accounts at once.

## Can I use this for my discipline/peer group?

> **Please make sure to only provide account information in your csv file and website with the consent of the account owner!** Even though we try to keep the stored information minimal, make sure everybody is comfortable with being on your list. Also keep in mind, that if you delete a name from the file, it will still be in the repositories history.

**If you wish to use this:** You should fork the original repo and follow the instructions provided there.  This version is likely out-of-date.  The original repo is here:

If you do create a “XY on Mastodon” page on any academic or scientific topic, please add it to the list [here](https://github.com/nathanlesage/academics-on-mastodon). If it’s on any other topic, let us know, too, so we can share it.
